# Vua-Leetcode

This repo contains a full-stack coding platform built with React + TypeScript (Vite) on the frontend and Node.js + Express + Prisma on the backend. It allows users to register, submit solutions to coding problems, and get results in real time, and also contribute problems to the platform.

## Purpose
• Provide a self-hosted Online Judge system where users can practice coding problems.  
• Showcase knowledge of microservices with Docker, RabbitMQ, and containerized language environments.  
• Demonstrate experience in designing and implementing large-scale applications.

## Tech Stack
• Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, React-Bootstrap  
• Backend: Node.js, Express, Prisma ORM, MySQL  
• Execution: Docker Compose for language containers (C, C++, Python, Java, Node)  
• Messaging: RabbitMQ for asynchronous job processing  
• Deployment: Docker, GitHub Actions

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo.  
2. Install dependencies (frontend, backend):  
    - In ./backend:  
      › npm install  
    - In ./frontend:  
      › npm install  
3. Set up environment variables in .env for database connection and DO credentials.  
4. Start Docker containers (language environments):  
    › docker compose -f docker-compose.langs.yaml up -d  
5. Start backend (API, Worker):  
    › npm run dev 
6. Start frontend:  
    › npm run dev

## Features
• User authentication and admin roles  
• Problem creation with testcases stored in DO Spaces  
• Real-time submissions (compile & judge)  
• RESTful APIs auto-generated by TSOA
